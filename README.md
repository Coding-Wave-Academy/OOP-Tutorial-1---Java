# 📚 Java Basics: Seven Console Programs

Welcome! This repository contains **seven small Java programs** designed to teach you core programming concepts in a friendly, hands‑on way. Each program lives in its own file and shows you how to:

1. Read user input  
2. Make decisions (`if` statements)  
3. Loop over data (`for` loops)  
4. Perform simple arithmetic  
5. Format output  

Whether you’re brand‑new to coding or brushing up on your Java skills, these examples will get you comfortable with the building blocks of any programming language.

## 🗂️ What’s Inside

| File                     | What It Does                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MaxMin.java** | Reads **five integers** and tells you the **largest** and **smallest**.      |
| **EvenOdd.java**         | Prompts for one number and reports if it’s **odd** or **even**.              |
| **AMultipleOf.java**   | Takes two numbers (a and b) and checks if **a is a multiple of b**.          |
| **CharCode.java**       | Prints a list of characters (A, B, C, a, b, c, 0, 1, 2, $, *, +, /, space) and shows their **ASCII codes**. |
| **Circle.java**   | Given a circle’s **radius**, computes its **diameter**, **circumference**, and **area**. |
| **SeparateFiveNum.java**  | Reads a **five‑digit number** and prints each digit separately.              |
| **SquareNCubes.java**    | Builds and displays a neat **table** of numbers 0–10 alongside their **squares** and **cubes**. |

## 🤔 How They Work (In Plain English)

- **Reading Input:** We use Java’s `Scanner` class to let the user type numbers.
- **Making Choices:** `if` statements decide things like “Is this number larger?” or “Is it even?”
- **Repeating Tasks:** `for` loops let us run the same check or calculation multiple times without rewriting code.
- **Math Tricks:**  
  - Dividing and using the remainder operator (`%`) helps pull individual digits out of a bigger number.  
  - `Math.PI` gives us the constant π for circle formulas.
- **Formatting Output:** `System.out.printf` helps us line things up nicely—whether it’s two numbers or a whole table.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or above installed  
- A terminal/command prompt  
- (Optional) An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code  

### Compile & Run
